# Heart Disease Risk Prediction — Machine Learning Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a **machine learning analysis pipeline** for predicting **heart disease risk** using structured clinical data.  
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on **data understanding, preprocessing, baseline modeling, and evaluation**.

Although the dataset originates from an academic context, this project is documented and structured to reflect **industry-quality analytical work**, emphasizing:

- Clear problem framing
- Transparent modeling choices
- Reproducible experimentation
- Honest reporting of results and limitations

This repository is part of my **professional machine learning portfolio**.

## Problem Definition

Heart disease is a major global health challenge.  
The objective of this project is to solve the following **binary classification problem**:

> **Given a set of patient clinical features, can we predict whether the patient has heart disease?**

The output is a binary label:

- `0` → No heart disease  
- `1` → Presence of heart disease

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of structured patient medical records commonly used in cardiovascular studies.

### Feature Examples

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol level  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- ECG results  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina

### Target Variable

- Binary indicator of heart disease presence

> The dataset is used for analysis, modeling practice, and skill demonstration.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the dataset before modeling.  
It includes:

- Inspecting data structure and feature types  
- Exploring feature distributions  
- Analyzing relationships between clinical variables and the target  
- Identifying potential data quality issues

This step ensures that modeling decisions are **data-driven rather than assumption-based**.

---

## Data Preparation & Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps implemented:

- Creating a working copy of the dataset  
- Separating features (`X`) and target (`y`)  
- Basic feature cleaning and formatting  
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

These steps follow standard ML practices to ensure **fair model evaluation** and prevent data leakage.

## Modeling Approach

### Baseline Model — Logistic Regression

A **Logistic Regression** classifier is used as the baseline model.

**Why Logistic Regression?**

- Well-suited for binary classification  
- Interpretable and commonly used in healthcare contexts  
- Provides a strong reference point for future model comparison

### Model Training

- The model is trained on the training subset  
- Predictions are generated on unseen test data

---

## Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:

- **Accuracy** as the primary metric  
- Comparison between predicted and true labels

**Observed Performance**

- Accuracy ≈ **52%**

This performance is treated as a **baseline**, highlighting:

- The inherent difficulty of the problem  
- The importance of feature quality  
- The need for further experimentation

---

## Model Comparison

Experimentation with **additional classification approaches** is included to:

- Compare performance across models  
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of each method  
- Encourage a benchmark-oriented mindset

This reflects **practical ML workflows**, not isolated model evaluation.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Establishing a baseline is critical before optimization  
- Model performance is strongly tied to data quality  
- Accuracy alone is insufficient for healthcare decision-making  
- Interpretability remains an important consideration

---

## Why This Project Belongs in an Industry Portfolio

This project demonstrates:

- Structured ML problem-solving  
- Responsible baseline modeling  
- Clear analytical thinking  
- Honest evaluation of results and limitations

It reflects **how I approach machine learning problems in practice**, starting with understanding the data before chasing performance.
